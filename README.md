# Portfolio-Managing

Load ETFs with highest YTD return from etfdb.com.
Calculate Sharpe Ratios since 2020/01/01 and choose the 100 hundred highest.
Compute the portfolio that minimizes the historical variance and another composition that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.
Calculate and plot the efficient frontier and the efficient frontier composition.
Finally I will calculate optimal portfolios for several risk measures. First I'm going to calculate the portfolio that maximizes risk adjusted return when CVaR is the risk measure, then I'm going to calculate the portfolios that maximize the risk adjusted return for all available risk measures and plot their efficient frontier composition.
